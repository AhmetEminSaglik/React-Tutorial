 -> PROPS VS STATE : 
 Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component,
 while state is used to manage data within a component. 
 Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component, 
 while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.

 -> following function is awesome : 
  
  OnClickEvent = (e) => {
    console.log(this);
  };


  


 ->  OnClickEvent = (number, e) => { // to get extra variable, e must be added to last index
    console.log(number);
    // console.log(e);
  };

  
  onClick={this.OnClickEvent.bind(this, 34) // this must be added to first index
