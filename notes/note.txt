 -> npx create-react-app my-app : downloads the fundamentals for react app
 after finished all process of upper command, should go to folder in my-app
 as : cd my-app , and then  run the following command : 
 npm start



 -> PROPS VS STATE : 
 Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component,
 while state is used to manage data within a component. 
 Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component, 
 while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.

 -> arrow functions does bind process automatically



 -> following function is awesome : 
  
  OnClickEvent = (e) => {
    console.log(this);
  };


  


 ->  OnClickEvent = (number, e) => { // to get extra variable, e must be added to last index
    console.log(number);
    // console.log(e);
  };

  
  onClick={this.OnClickEvent.bind(this, 34) // this must be added to first index



 -> Create Context API :
 1-)
  const UserContext = React.createContext();
  export class UserProvider extends Component {
    state= {...}
    render(){
      return(
        <UserContext.Provider value={this.state}>
         {this.props.children} 
      </UserContext.Provider>
      )
    }
    }

const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export default UserConsumer;


 -> Action : 
 Process will be realized and items will be send is decided here.  has 2 properties :
 Type : process will be realized
 Payload : item will be send

 
 -> Dispatch :
 Send actions to context. Is located in Provider state.

 -> Reducer : 
 updates state according to Action type that is send with Dispatch
